The River Flood index is relevant to hydrological applications, transport, and disaster risk management.
This Index is based on 50-year flood recurrence values based on maximum river discharge values for the 50-year return period and is part of the River flood type of the Wet and Dry category of the classification.
A higher/lower value indicates reduced/increased river discharge and thus lower/higher River flood risk.

<br />**Definition**

The River Flood index is the 50-year flood recurrence value based on maximum river discharge. It is estimated from annual daily maximum river discharge using a Gumbel distribution. Other values from several recurrence periods (10, 5 and 2 years) are also shown as complementary information.

<br />**Data Sources**

The data was assembled on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) based on climate projections hosted on the C3S Climate Data Store (CDS). The Index data is from a set of 30-year statistics from two hydrological models (forced by eight bias-corrected multi-model simulations from the EURO-CORDEX experiment. The hydrological models are from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI, E-HYPE model) and Wageningen University (VIC-WUR model). The hydrological simulations have a 5km x 5km resolution and cover scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. More information about the dataset can be found in the corresponding [CDS documentation resources](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-hydrology-variables-derived-projections).
