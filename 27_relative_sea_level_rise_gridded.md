<br />**Context**

The Relative Sea Level Rise index is relevant to coastal management. This Index is part of the relative Sea Level type of the Coastal category of the classification. A higher/lower index value indicates higher/lower Relative Sea Level Rise and thus higher/lower risks.

<br />**Definition**

The Relative Sea Level Rise index (cm) is the annual mean sea level height relative to the 1986-2005 period.

<br />**Data Sources**

The data was assembled on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) based on reanalysis data hosted on the C3S Climate Data Store (CDS).
The observed and simulated index data are from the Global sea level change time series from 1950 to 2050 derived from reanalysis and high resolution CMIP6 climate projections dataset.
The dataset is from a tidal model forced by the ERA5 reanalysis and a set of 5 multi-model simulations from the HighResMIP CMIP6 experiment. The index data simulations have a 10-minute temporal resolution, a variable spatial resolution (from 0.1° at the coast to 1° for the open ocean) and cover scenario SSP5-8.5. More technical specifications can be found in the [dataset documentation](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-water-level-change-timeseries-cmip6).
