The European Climate Data Explorer (ECDE) application is an online visualisation application of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) driven by the European Environment Agency (EEA) allowing for flexible temporal and spatial exploration and analysis of recent past trends and projected future changes of a range of key climate indicators from multiple datasets to address informational needs regarding climate impact indicators relevant to climate change adaptation national initiatives across the EU.

The entire dataset behind the ECDE application is going to be published in the CADS (the renewed Copernicus Climate Data Store) soon. It will be a single catalogue entry in the CADS and will allow reproducibility and reusability of the plots provided by this application. Take a look at the User Guidance for more details on the practical use of the application and for more information on the available indicators.
