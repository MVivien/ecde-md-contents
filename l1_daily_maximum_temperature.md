<br />**Context**

The Maximum Temperature Index is relevant to human health, agriculture and biodiversity. It indicates the temperature of the coldest day of a period, typically of the year, but also over a particular season or month. This Index is part of the Cold spell and frost Hazard type of the Heat and Cold category of the classification.

A higher value indicates higher temperatures and thus more heat stress on people and the environment.

<br />**Definition**

The maximum value of daily maximum temperature over a period (°C).

In weather and climate models temperature is the variable simulating atmospheric air temperature at 2m above the surface. This Index is usually presented as annual, seasonal or monthly values over a reference period.

<br />**Data Sources**
The data was assembled on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) based on climate projections hosted on the C3S Climate Data Store (CDS). The Index is calculated from a set of nine bias-corrected multi-model simulations from the EURO-CORDEX experiment. These simulations have a spatial resolution of 0.25° x 0.25°, a 3-hourly output, and cover scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. More information about the dataset can be found in the corresponding [CDS documentation resources](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-energy-derived-projections).
