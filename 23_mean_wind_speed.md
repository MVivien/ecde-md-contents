<br />**Context**

The Mean Wind Speed index is mainly relevant to the energy sector. This Index is based on daily 10m wind speed and is part of the Severe Storm hazard type of the Wind category of the classification.

The index gives the mean daily 10m wind speed of a reference period, here 1981-2010.

A higher/lower value indicates higher/lower wind speeds..

<br />**Definition**

The mean daily 10m wind speed over a period (m s-1).

<br />**Data Sources**

The data was assembled on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) based on climate projections hosted on the C3S Climate Data Store (CDS). The Index is calculated from the ERA5 reanalysis and a set of nine bias-corrected multi-model simulations from the EURO-CORDEX experiment. These simulations have a spatial resolution of 0.25° x 0.25°, a 3-hourly output, and cover scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. More information about the dataset can be found in the corresponding [CDS documentation resources](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-energy-derived-projections).
