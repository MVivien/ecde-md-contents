<br />**Context**

The River Discharge index is relevant to hydrological applications, transport, and disaster risk management.
This Index is based on daily river discharge values and is part of the River flood type of the Wet and Dry category of the classification.
A higher/lower value indicates reduced/increased river discharge and thus lower/higher River flood risk.

<br />**Definition**

The River Discharge index is defined as the annual mean daily river discharge (m³⋅s⁻¹).

<br />**Data Sources**

The data was assembled on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) based on climate projections hosted on the C3S Climate Data Store (CDS). The Index data is from a set of 30-year statistics from two hydrological models (forced by eight bias-corrected multi-model simulations from the EURO-CORDEX experiment. The hydrological models are from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI, E-HYPE model) and Wageningen University (VIC-WUR model). The hydrological simulations have a 5km x 5km resolution and cover scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. More information about the dataset can be found in the corresponding [CDS documentation resources](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-hydrology-variables-derived-projections).
