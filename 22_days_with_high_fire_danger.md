The High Fire Danger Days index is relevant to Forestry but can also indirectly affect others such as tourism, transport and energy. This Index is based on the Fire Weather Index (FWI) and is part of the Wildfire type of the Wet and Dry category of the classification.
The index gives the number of days in a given period presenting favourable meteorological conditions to triggering a wildfire.
The higher the Index, the higher the risk of wildfire.

<br />**Definition**

The count of days in a period with a FWI value greater than 30 (Number of days) based upon the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) classification.
The Fire Weather Index (FWI) is a meteorologically based index used worldwide to estimate fire danger. It is developed by the Canadian Forestry Service to estimate forest fire ignition and spread conditions based on several weather variables (temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, and wind speed).

<br />**Data Sources**

The data was assembled on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) based on climate projections hosted on the C3S Climate Data Store (CDS).
The observed index data are from a dataset based on the ERA5 reanalysis and updated in near real time. It is produced by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service for the Global ECMWF Fire Forecasting model (GEFF) and the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS). The simulated index data are from a set of 6 bias-adjusted multi-model simulations from the EURO-CORDEX experiment. These simulations have a daily temporal resolution, a spatial resolution of 0.1° x 0.1° and cover scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5.
