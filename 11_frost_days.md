<br />**Context**

The Frost Days Index is relevant to agriculture. This Index is part of the Cold spell and frost Hazard type of the Heat and Cold category of the classification.

The index measures the number of days with frost conditions. It is mainly used in agriculture to account for frost damages, but it can be relevant to other sectors.

A higher/lower value means more/less frost days.

<br />**Definition**

The number of days with daily minimum temperature below 0°C.
In weather and climate models temperature is the variable simulating atmospheric air temperature at 2m above the surface. This Index is usually presented as annual, seasonal or monthly values over a reference period.

<br />**Data Sources**

The data was assembled on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) based on climate projections hosted on the C3S Climate Data Store (CDS). The Index is calculated from the ERA5 reanalysis and a set of nine bias-corrected multi-model simulations from the EURO-CORDEX experiment. These simulations have a spatial resolution of 0.25° x 0.25°, a 3-hourly output, and cover scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. More information about the dataset can be found in the corresponding [CDS documentation resources](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-energy-derived-projections).
