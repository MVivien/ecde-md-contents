<br />**Context**

The Tropical Nights index is relevant to human health. This index is based on daily minimum temperature and is part of the Extreme Heat Hazard type of the Heat and Cold category of the classification.

High values of minimum temperature cause physiological discomfort during periods of high temperatures by preventing body temperature to cool-off during the night.

A higher value indicates more Tropical Nights and thus more stress on human health caused by extreme minimum temperatures.

<br />**Definition**

The count of days when daily minimum temperature remains above 20°C (Number of days).

<br />**Data Sources**

The data was assembled on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) based on climate projections hosted on the C3S Climate Data Store (CDS). The Index is calculated from the ERA5 reanalysis and a set of nine bias-corrected multi-model simulations from the EURO-CORDEX experiment. These simulations have a spatial resolution of 0.25° x 0.25°, a 3-hourly output, and cover scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. More information about the dataset can be found in the corresponding [CDS documentation resources](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-energy-derived-projections).
