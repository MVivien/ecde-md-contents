<br />**Context**

The Tiger Mosquito Climatic Season Length index is relevant to human health. The tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) is an invasive species from south-east Asia favoured by a warmer climate and represents a serious threat as it transmits vector-borne diseases such as dengue and chikungunya. Environmental factors, among which weather conditions, affect both the potential presence and seasonal activity of the tiger mosquito.

A higher value indicates a longer season and thus a higher risk to human health.

<br />**Definition**

The season length of the climatic suitability of tiger mosquito presence (Days).
The Tiger mosquito's climatic suitability seasonal presence is determined by temperature thresholds and hours of sunlight (photoperiod) during spring (when egg hatching occurs) and autumn (a period of suspended development or diapause). In spring the temperature should be above 10.5°C and the photoperiod above 11.25 hours and in autumn the temperature should be below 9.5°C and the photoperiod below 13.5 hours. The latter is conditioned by the ability of the mosquito to survive the winter combined with a threshold on annual rainfall. Survival conditions are considered as unsuitable for January temperatures below 0°C and annual rainfall below 500 mm.

<br />**Data Sources**

The data was assembled on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) based on climate projections hosted on the C3S Climate Data Store (CDS). The Index is calculated from a set of eight bias-corrected multi-model simulations from the EURO-CORDEX experiment. These simulations have a spatial resolution of 0.11° x 0.11°, a daily output, and cover scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The data covers the period 1971 to 2099 and statistics are averaged for 30 years in overlapping time periods of 10 years apart. Finally, the time series are averaged for the model ensemble.
