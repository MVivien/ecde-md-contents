The Tiger Mosquito Climatic Suitability index is relevant to human health. The tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) is an invasive species from south-east Asia favoured by a warmer climate and represents a serious threat as it transmits vector-borne diseases such as dengue and chikungunya. Environmental factors, among which weather conditions, affect both the potential presence and seasonal activity of the tiger mosquito.

A higher value indicates a better Climatic Suitability and thus a higher risk to human health.

<br />**Definition**

The Climatic Suitability index of Tiger mosquito presence (Dimensionless, from 0 to 100).

The Tiger mosquito's climatic suitability is determined by summer temperatures, January temperatures and annual rainfall. The suitability is null for summer temperatures lower than 15°C or higher than 30°C, with a maximum between 20°C and 25°C. It is null for January temperatures lower than - 1°C and annual rainfall lower than 450 mm, and maximal for January temperatures above 3°C and annual rainfall above 800 mm.

<br />**Data Sources**

The data was assembled on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) based on climate projections hosted on the C3S Climate Data Store (CDS).

The Index is from a dataset based on a set of eight bias-corrected multi-model simulations from the EURO-CORDEX experiment. These simulations have a spatial resolution of 0.11° x 0.11°, a daily output, and cover scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The index data cover the period 1971 to 2099 and statistics are averaged for 30 years in overlapping time periods of 10 years apart. Finally, the time series are averaged for the model ensemble.

More information about the dataset can be found in the corresponding [CDS documentation resources](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-health-vector).
