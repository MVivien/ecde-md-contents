<br />**Context**

The Maximum Consecutive Five-Day Precipitation index is relevant to agriculture, water management, transport and the urban sector. This Index is based on daily precipitation and is part of the Extreme Precipitation Hazard type of the Wet and Dry category of the classification.

The index gives the maximum precipitation amount that occurred over 5 consecutive days in a given period.

A higher/lower value indicates more/less extreme precipitations.

<br />**Definition**

Maximum five days cumulated precipitation (mm).

In weather and climate models total precipitation is the flux of water equivalent (rain or snow) reaching the land surface (expressed as kg.m-2.sec-2 and converted to mm/day). Precipitation is usually presented as annual, seasonal or monthly cumulated values over the considered period but extremes are cumulated on shorter periods (eg daily, 3-Day, or 5-days maximums).

<br />**Data Sources**

The data was assembled on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) based on climate projections hosted on the C3S Climate Data Store (CDS). The Index is calculated from the ERA5 reanalysis and a set of nine bias-corrected multi-model simulations from the EURO-CORDEX experiment. These simulations have a spatial resolution of 0.25° x 0.25°, a 3-hourly output, and cover scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. More information about the dataset can be found in the corresponding [CDS documentation resources](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-energy-derived-projections).
