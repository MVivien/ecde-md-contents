<br />**Context**

The Snowfall Amount is relevant to the tourism and water sectors. This Index is part of the Snow and Land Ice Hazard type of the Snow and Ice category of the classification.
A higher/lower index value indicates higher/lower snowfall amounts and thus higher/lower snowfall precipitation.

<br />**Definition**

The Snowfall Amount index (mm) corresponds to the cumulative value of snowfall precipitation over the winter season from November to April.

<br />**Data Sources**

The data was assembled on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) based on reanalysis data hosted on the C3S Climate Data Store (CDS).
The observed and simulated index data are from the Mountain tourism meteorological and snow indicators for Europe from 1950 to 2100 derived from reanalysis and climate projections dataset. The dataset is based on the UERRA reanalysis and a set of 9 bias-adjusted multi-model simulations from the EURO-CORDEX experiment. The index data simulations have an annual temporal resolution, a spatial resolution over NUTS3 regions, a vertical resolution of 100m and cover scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5.
