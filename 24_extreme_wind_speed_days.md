<br />**Context**

The Extreme Wind Days index is relevant to forestry, infrastructure, buildings, energy and transport. This Index is based on daily wind speed and is part of the Severe Storm hazard type of the Wind category of the classification.

The index gives the number of days in a year with daily wind speed exceeding the 98th percentile threshold of a reference period, here 1981-2010.

A higher/lower value indicates more/less days with extreme winds.

<br />**Definition**

The count of days in a year with daily 10m wind speed exceeding the 98th percentile threshold over a reference period, here the 1981-2010 period (days).

<br />**Data Sources**

The data was assembled on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) based on climate projections hosted on the C3S Climate Data Store (CDS). The Index is calculated from the ERA5 reanalysis and a set of nine bias-corrected multi-model simulations from the EURO-CORDEX experiment. These simulations have a spatial resolution of 0.25° x 0.25°, a 3-hourly output, and cover scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. More information about the dataset can be found in the corresponding [CDS documentation resources](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-energy-derived-projections).
