The Mean Soil Moisture index is relevant to forestry, water management and, to a lesser degree, in agriculture.

This Index is based on soil moisture content and is part of the Drought Hazard type of the Wet and Dry category of the classification.
A higher/lower value indicates higher/lower soil moisture content.

<br />**Definition**

The soil moisture is defined as the monthly mean values of soil moisture in the root zone as the fraction of the field capacity volume over a 30 year period.

<br />**Data Sources**

The data was assembled on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) based on climate projections hosted on the C3S Climate Data Store (CDS). The Index data is from a set of 30-year statistics from two hydrological models (forced by eight bias-corrected multi-model simulations from the EURO-CORDEX experiment. The hydrological models are from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI, E-HYPE model) and Wageningen University (VIC-WIR Model). The hydrological simulations have a 5km x 5km resolution and cover scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. More information about the dataset can be found in the corresponding [CDS documentation resources](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-hydrology-variables-derived-projections).
