<br />**Context**

The Extreme Sea Level index is relevant to coastal management. This Index is part of the Coastal flooding of the Coastal category of the classification.
A higher/lower index value indicates higher/lower Extreme Sea Level and thus higher/lower risks.

<br />**Definition**

The Extreme Sea Level index (m) is the Total water level value for a return period of 100 years caused by tidal and surge levels as well as their interactions but without including sea level rise.

<br />**Data Sources**

The data was assembled on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) based on reanalysis data hosted on the C3S Climate Data Store (CDS).
The observed and simulated index data are from the Global sea level change indicators from 1950 to 2050 derived from reanalysis and high resolution CMIP6 climate projections dataset.
The dataset is from a tidal model forced by the ERA5 reanalysis and a set of 5 multi-model simulations from the HighResMIP CMIP6 experiment. The index data simulations have an annual temporal resolution, a variable spatial resolution (from 0.1° at the coast to 1° for the open ocean) and cover scenario SSP5-8.5. More technical specifications can be found in the [dataset documentation](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-water-level-change-indicators-cmip6).
