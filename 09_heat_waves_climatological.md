<br />**Context**

The Climatological Heatwave Days index is relevant to human health, agriculture, energy, wildfire and infrastructure. This Index is part of the Extreme Heat Hazard type of the Heat and Cold category of the classification.

The index counts the number of days in a year within prolonged periods of unusually high temperatures.

The higher/lower the value, the longer/shorter the heatwave.

<br />**Definition**

The count of days under climatological heatwaves conditions (Number of days). A climatological heatwave is a period of at least three consecutive days exceeding the 99th percentile of the daily maximum temperatures of the May to September season during a reference period.

<br />**Data Sources**

The data was assembled on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) based on climate projections hosted on the C3S Climate Data Store (CDS). The Index data is 30-year period statistics based on a set of eight bias-corrected multi-model simulations ensemble from the EURO-CORDEX experiment. These simulations have a spatial resolution of 0.1° x 0.1° and cover scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. More information about the dataset can be found in the corresponding [CDS documentation resources](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-heat-and-cold-spells).
