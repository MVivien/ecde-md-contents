The Fire Weather Index (FWI) is relevant to forestry, local planning and disaster risk management. This Index is part of the Drought Hazard type of the Wet and Dry category of the classification.

A higher index value indicates better weather conditions for wildfires and thus a higher risk.

<br />**Definition**

Fire Weather Index (Dimensionless). The Fire Weather Index (FWI) is a meteorologically based index used worldwide to estimate fire danger. It is developed by the Canadian Forestry Service to estimate forest fire ignition and spread conditions based on several weather variables (temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, and wind speed).

<br />**Data Sources**

The data was assembled on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) based on reanalysis data hosted on the C3S Climate Data Store (CDS).
The observed index data are from a dataset based on the ERA5 reanalysis and updated in near real time. It is produced by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) for the Global ECMWF Fire Forecasting model (GEFF) and the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS). The simulated index data are from a set of 5 multi-model simulations from the EURO-CORDEX experiment. These simulations have a daily temporal resolution, a spatial resolution of 0.1° x 0.1° and cover scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5.
